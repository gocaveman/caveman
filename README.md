# CAVEMAN

**Awesome website primitives for Go. One package at a time.**

The Caveman Project is a library, or more like a collection of packages, that provides tooling to solve common website and web application problems.

This is a work in progress and packages will be updated as frequently as time allows.  The current plan is to work toward a 1.0 release with as many stable packages as possible by some time later in 2018.

## Packages

* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/renderer](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/renderer) **EXPERIMENTAL**
* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/uifiles](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/uifiles) **EXPERIMENTAL**
* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/webutil](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/webutil) **INCOMPLETE**
