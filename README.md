# THE CAVEMAN PROJECT

**Awesome web primitives for Go. One package at a time.**

The Caveman Project is a library, or more like a collection of packages, that provides tooling to solve common website and web application problems.

This is a work in progress and packages will be updated as frequently as time allows.  The current plan is to work toward a 1.0 release with as many stable packages as possible by some time later in 2018.

The listing below gives the current status of packages within the Caveman project.  **INCOMPLETE** packages are still being added to and edited frequently;  **EXPERIMENTAL** packages are functional and can be used but might undergo major changes; **ALPHA**, **BETA** and **RELEASE CANDIDATE** have their usual meanings and packages for which API stability is guaranteed will be marked **STABLE**.  Stable packages will not have breaking API changes without a major number release on this repository and a very good reason to do so.

## Packages

* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/renderer](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/renderer) **EXPERIMENTAL**
* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/uifiles](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/uifiles) **EXPERIMENTAL**
* [github.com/gocaveman/caveman/webutil](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman/webutil) **INCOMPLETE**

NOTE: Packages in the [Caveman](https://godoc.org/github.com/gocaveman/caveman) repository but not listed above should be considered INCOMPLETE and subject to major changes or even removal.
