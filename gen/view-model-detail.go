package gen

// generates form from model

// mobile-first

// embedability - think about what happens if we want to move this to an include file
//  and call it from JS in a modal or something, what can we do to make that scenario painless

// can customize fields

// loads page data from controller

// need to be able to pass in something that allows us to look up relations - definitely needs think-through

// error message handling on saving
// including login redirection for when login times out
